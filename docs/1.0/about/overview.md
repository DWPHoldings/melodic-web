## Team

Melodic is inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the CSS/JavaScript framework we've been using at Inspire to date. Initially adapted from Bootstrap by creative director Greg Beck and full-stack developer Ariel Kirkwood, all of our designers and developers will be able to play a role in evolving this framework moving forward.

## History

See Bootstrap's history [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/about/overview/#history).

We chose to fork Bootstrap 4 to create the beginning of a design system that initially supports Web pages and applications, but will grow and evolve to support more digital user interfaces and experiences in the future.
